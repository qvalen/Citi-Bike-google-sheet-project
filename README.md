# Citi-Bike-google-sheet-project
Analyzing City Bikes Data with Google Sheets**

## Project Overview  
In this project, I performed a comprehensive **data analysis on Citi Bike data** using **Google Sheets**.  
The goal was to uncover key patterns and trends within the dataset by applying both **descriptive** and **predictive** statistical techniques.  

The analysis explored metrics such as **ridership behavior**, **usage trends**, and **forecasting demand**, ultimately transforming raw data into actionable insights that can improve bike-sharing operations.  


## Key Highlights  
- Utilized **descriptive statistics** to understand data distribution and summary metrics.  
- Applied **predictive analytics** to forecast future demand and optimize bike allocation strategies.  
- Designed **interactive and visually appealing charts** to effectively communicate findings.  
- Extracted **actionable insights** to support data-driven decision-making for urban mobility improvements.  


## Tools & Techniques  
- **Google Sheets** → for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization  
- **Descriptive Statistics** → mean, median, mode, frequency distributions  
- **Predictive Techniques** → trend analysis and simple forecasting  
- **Data Visualization** → bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and dashboards  


## Outcome  
The analysis provided meaningful insights into **Citi Bike usage patterns**, helping stakeholders make **informed decisions** on fleet management and infrastructure planning.  
This project demonstrates the analytical power of **Google Sheets** for both **descriptive and predictive analytics** without requiring advanced programming tools.
