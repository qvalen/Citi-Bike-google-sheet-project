# Citi-Bike-google-sheet-project
Analyzing City Bikes Data with Google Sheets**

**Description:**
In this project, I performed comprehensive data analysis on city bikes data using Google Sheets. I employed descriptive and predictive statistical techniques to uncover patterns and trends within the dataset. The analysis included examining key metrics such as ridership patterns, usage trends, and predictive modeling to forecast future demand.

**Key Highlights:**
- Utilized descriptive statistics to understand the distribution and summary statistics of the data.
- Employed predictive statistics to forecast future demand and optimize bike allocation strategies.
- Created visually appealing graphs and visualizations to present the findings effectively.
- Extracted actionable insights to inform decision-making processes for bike-sharing initiatives.

**Tools Used:**
- Google Sheets for data manipulation and analysis.
- Descriptive and predictive statistical techniques.
- Data visualization tools for creating insightful graphs and charts.

**Outcome:**
The analysis provided valuable insights into city bike usage patterns, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to enhance bike-sharing services and infrastructure.
